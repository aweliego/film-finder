# Film Finder

## Description

This film finder app comes from a guided project on Codecademy to practice making requests with the fetch API.
As the name indicates, it helps you find your next watch by genre, and saves the movies you like or dislike.

## API

This project uses the [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. Please use your own key.

## Extra features

I took the initiative to add the following features:
- Functionality to store the liked and disliked movies in the local storage as well as in a side bar
- Functionality to clear all liked/disliked movies or to delete them individually
- Allow the API to randomise results from a random page of results instead of just the first page
- Improvements in the layout, positioning and general styles
- Responsiveness
